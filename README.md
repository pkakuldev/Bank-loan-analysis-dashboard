> 🚀 **Bank Loan Data Analysis Dashboard** :

Analyze bank loan application data to track key KPIs, monitor loan performance, and identify trends across regions, purposes, loan terms, and borrower demographics.

📝**Description/Purpose** :

This project aims to analyze and visualize bank loan data to provide insights into total loan applications, funded amounts, repayment amounts, interest rates, debt-to-income ratios, and loan performance quality. The dashboard helps in tracking MTD/PMTD performance, identifying high- and low-performing loan segments, and supporting data-driven decision-making.

🧰**Tech Stack** :

• Microsoft Excel – Data cleaning, transformation, and visualization

• SQL – Data extraction, cleaning, transformation, and aggregation.

• Power BI – Dashboard design and data visualization.
 
• DAX Measures – For creating calculated metrics and MTD/PMTD comparisons.

• Data Validation via SQL – Ensuring accuracy of dashboard numbers by cross-checking with SQL queries.

📌**Feature and Highlights**

• **Goal** :
To extract actionable business insights from bank loan data by identifying trends in loan disbursement, repayment, risk exposure, and customer segments, and to present these findings through an interactive, KPI-driven Power BI dashboard. 

• **Walkthrough on Key Visuals** :

**KPI Cards**: Display Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, Total Amount Received, Average Interest Rate, and Average DTI Ratio, with both overall and MTD/PMTD views.

**Loan Quality Metrics**: Good vs Bad loan segmentation based on repayment status (Fully Paid, Current, Charged Off) with counts, percentages, and amounts.

**Monthly Trends**: Line and column charts showing monthly fluctuations in applications, funded amounts, and repayments.

**Regional Analysis**: Map and bar charts highlighting state-wise loan performance.

**Loan Term & Purpose Analysis**: Breakdown of applications, funding, and repayments by loan term and purpose.

**Customer Profile Analysis**: Insights by home ownership status and employment length.

**Loan Status Grid View**: Tabular breakdown of loan performance metrics grouped by loan status.
